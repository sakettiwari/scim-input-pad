The format of the file is:


SCIM_Input_Pad
VERSION_1_0

BEGIN_GROUP
NAME=...

BEGIN_TABLE
NAME=...
COLUMNS=...

(Put Symbols here)

END_TABLE

END_GROUP


There can be several groups in a file, and several tables in a group.
The name of group and table can have language suffix, like:
NAME[zh_CN]=...

Multiple names for different languages are allowed.

Now the translation of group/table name are done by intltool.
All localized strings will be stored in po files. So do not edit the data
files directly to add localized names. Add po file for your language instead.

Each table can have one COLUMNS parameter to set the number of columns
this table should be shown.

The format of the symbols can be:

1. UTF-8 encoded strings, separated by space or return. Like:
äž äº äž
å äº å­

2. Hex number of the unicode codes, separated by space or return. Like;
0x3001 0x3002 0x3003

3. A '*' followed by KeyEvent name, separated by space or return. Like:
*Return *Tab *Hangul_Hanja

4. A single '*' indicates an empty space when displaying.



You are always welcome to contribute us new symbol files, suggestions and bug reports.
